steps to work with routing
---------------------------
can be done in 2 ways

1. using hyperlinks with routerLink ( DONT USE href)

2. using Router API ( adding routing programatically)

steps
------
1. every component that u want to route to should have a route path configured in app-routing.module.ts file
    pls note  that u can also configure route paths in app.module.ts
2. use the <router-outlet> tag
