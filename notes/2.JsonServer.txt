1. install json server in your angular appln.
       npm install json-server
   this will install json server in our angular project and a dependecy entry is made in package.json
2. start the json server    
    json-server --watch db.json
   this. will create a db.json file and some sample json data will be present
3. erase the content of db.json file and place the student array in json format
4. now jason server will automatically create the endpoints based on the data in db.json file

get request for all students
http://localhost:3000/students

get request for a student
http://localhost:3000/students/102

delete request
http://localhost:3000/students/103

put request with request body
http://localhost:3000/students/103

post request with request body
http://localhost:3000/students

5. next from angular appln, using HttpClient API lets consume these endpoints
